"mainEntity": [{
"@type": "Question","name": "What are typical hard money terms?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Typical hard money loan terms include higher interest rates than traditional loans, shorter repayment periods (often ranging from a few months to a few years), and lower loan-to-value ratios. Fees such as origination points and closing costs may also be involved."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What is the hard money scenario?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "The hard money scenario refers to the situation where borrowers opt for hard money loans due to their inability to secure financing from traditional lenders, often because of factors such as poor credit history, urgent funding needs, or unconventional property types."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What credit score is needed for a hard money loan?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Credit score requirements for hard money loans vary, but they typically focus more on the value of the property being used as collateral rather than the borrower&#39;s credit score. However, a higher credit score may still improve the borrower&#39;s chances of approval and influence the loan terms."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Why is it called a hard money loan?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Hard money loans are called so because they are secured by &quot;hard&quot; assets such as real estate, which serve as collateral for the loan. Unlike traditional loans that rely heavily on the borrower&#39;s creditworthiness, hard money loans prioritize the value of the collateral."

<div class="collapse" id="collapse0" aria-labelledby="heading0" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Typical hard money loan terms include higher interest rates than traditional loans, shorter repayment periods (often ranging from a few months to a few years), and lower loan-to-value ratios. Fees such as origination points and closing costs may also be involved.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>The hard money scenario refers to the situation where borrowers opt for hard money loans due to their inability to secure financing from traditional lenders, often because of factors such as poor credit history, urgent funding needs, or unconventional property types.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Credit score requirements for hard money loans vary, but they typically focus more on the value of the property being used as collateral rather than the borrower&#39;s credit score. However, a higher credit score may still improve the borrower&#39;s chances of approval and influence the loan terms.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse3" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Hard money loans are called so because they are secured by &quot;hard&quot; assets such as real estate, which serve as collateral for the loan. Unlike traditional loans that rely heavily on the borrower&#39;s creditworthiness, hard money loans prioritize the value of the collateral.</p>

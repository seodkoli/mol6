"@type": "Question","name": "What are the three types of hard money?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "The three types of hard money loans are fix-and-flip loans, bridge loans, and construction loans. Fix-and-flip loans are used to purchase and renovate properties for resale, bridge loans provide short-term financing until permanent financing is secured, and construction loans fund new construction projects."
}

"@type": "Question","name": "What is the difference between a bank loan and a hard money loan?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Bank loans typically have lower interest rates and longer terms compared to hard money loans, which often come with higher interest rates and shorter repayment periods. Additionally, bank loans usually require extensive documentation and have stricter qualification criteria, whereas hard money loans focus more on the value of the collateral."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "How do you write a hard money offer?",

"@type": "Answer",
"text": "To write a hard money offer, borrowers typically provide details about the property they intend to use as collateral, their requested loan amount, desired terms (such as interest rate and repayment schedule), and any additional information relevant to the loan transaction. It&#39;s essential to be clear, concise, and accurate in the offer."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What is the opposite of a hard money loan?",

"@type": "Answer",
